Files and guidelines for: UH Introduction to Variant Calling using Galaxy

In this workshop we will analyse long read next-generation sequence data generated from the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus. This data was collected during the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic and is part of the study showing that COVID-19 was a product of an environmental spillover event. The data consists of .fastq files, which were produced using an Oxford Nanopore sequencing machine (https://nanoporetech.com/). We will use this data, plus the original genome sequence of a virus collected during the outbreak in Wuhan.
